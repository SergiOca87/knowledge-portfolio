				Origin The concept of a knowledge portfolio has been around for
				several decades, with various sources contributing to its
				development. While Karl Wiig is widely credited with introducing
				the term "knowledge portfolio" in his 1997 book, "Knowledge
				Management: An Introduction and Perspective," there are other
				references to the idea of managing knowledge as a portfolio that
				predate Wiig's work. For example, in "The Pragmatic Programmer"
				book published in 1999, authors Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
				discuss the concept of a "skills portfolio" as a way for
				software developers to manage and enhance their professional
				skills over time. While they did not use the term "knowledge
				portfolio" explicitly, the idea of tracking and reflecting on
				one's experience, knowledge, and accomplishments shares
				similarities with the concept of a knowledge portfolio.

				Why A knowledge portfolio is a valuable tool for individuals and
				organizations seeking to manage their intellectual assets over
				time. By organizing and reflecting on their knowledge and
				skills, individuals and organizations can identify gaps in their
				knowledge and prioritize areas for learning and development. A
				well-managed knowledge portfolio can also help to demonstrate
				one's expertise and value to potential employers or clients. In
				today's rapidly changing global economy, staying up-to-date with
				the latest developments in one's field is essential for
				remaining competitive. A knowledge portfolio provides a
				structured way to manage and develop one's knowledge assets,
				ensuring that they stay relevant and valuable over time. By
				investing in a knowledge portfolio, individuals and
				organizations can enhance their problem-solving abilities, make
				better decisions, and create new opportunities for growth and
				success.

				Invest Investing in a knowledge portfolio requires a commitment
				to ongoing learning and development. This may involve taking
				courses, attending conferences and workshops, reading books and
				articles, participating in professional networks, and engaging
				in reflective practice. By investing in their knowledge
				portfolio, individuals and organizations can stay up-to-date
				with the latest developments in their field, acquire new skills
				and knowledge, and remain competitive in a constantly evolving
				business environment. Maintaining a knowledge portfolio also
				requires regular reflection and self-assessment. Individuals and
				organizations should periodically review their portfolio to
				assess their strengths and weaknesses and identify areas for
				improvement. By setting goals and tracking progress over time,
				they can ensure that their knowledge portfolio continues to
				evolve and remain relevant. In conclusion, the idea of managing
				knowledge as an asset has been around for many years and has
				been described in various forms by different authors. Today, a
				knowledge portfolio is a valuable tool for individuals and
				organizations seeking to manage their intellectual assets in a
				constantly changing global economy. By investing in ongoing
				learning and development and regularly reflecting on their
				knowledge and skills, they can stay ahead of the curve and
				create new opportunities for growth and success.
